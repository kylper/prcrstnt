An anti-procrastination extension!

Built by Kyle Permuy!

#Continued Work
This was built in less than 10 hours for MLH LocalHackDay (October 10th) (with the Young Hackers/General Assembly in NYC).

Much more work needs to be done, this was built for demo.
- We need to add a backend server in Node.js/MongoDB for managing User Data and tasks.
